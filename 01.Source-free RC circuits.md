When we subtract the voltage in earth from the voltage in A, we will get Vc. So Vs = Va - 0 = Va. Moreover, the series of 8 and 12 resistors is 20. 
We know that i = V / R, so Ix = Va / 20 = Vc / 20.

First we need to have overall R which is can be calculated first using parallel, then series rule. We put R and C in ta and find the result and then design Vc(t) formula. 
Then to be able to find Va we need to use KCL for these two resistors 8 and 12 || 6 (which is 4).  I0 is equal Vx - Vc / 8.

In RC circuits when it is dc (the stable), in t<0, capacitor becomes open circuit.
